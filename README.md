# Gridworld

Projects for MSCH-G 488 Artificial Intelligence for Games

Simulation of "sheep" and "grass".
The sheep can move towards other sheep, create new sheep, move towards and eat grass, and wonder around.
The grass "grows" and "dies" at a set rate, and will randomly create new grass.

Built using Unity 2019.4.19f1.
